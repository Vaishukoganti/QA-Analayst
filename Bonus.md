Comprehensive Documentation & Test Case Management:

#For every new feature or enhancement, I would ensure thorough documentation during manual testing.

#This includes writing detailed test cases, capturing edge scenarios, and documenting any bugs found.

#This not only helps in future regression runs but also serves as a clear reference for other team members.


Automation Integration Early (Shift Left Testing):

#While manually testing new features, I will also implement automated tests in parallel.

#These tests will be added to the CI pipeline so they can run automatically on every code push.

#This will help catch regressions early and ensure previous functionalities remain stable with ongoing development.


Structured Regression Testing Before Deployment:

#I will maintain a robust regression test suite that includes both functional tests and previously reported bugs.

#Before every deployment, especially after a code freeze, I will ensure this suite is executed to catch any last-minute issues.

#This ensures smoother, safer releases with minimal surprises in production.

Additional Improvements:

#Collaborate closely with the product and development teams to align on feature expectations and edge cases early.

#Introduce a clear QA workflow from enhancement to development to QA to release, ensuring each stage is tracked and communicated clearly.

#Use mock servers (e.g., via Postman) to start testing earlier in the development cycle, even before the backend is fully ready, enabling a true Shift Left QA approach.





RE: Exploratory testing

As part of my QA process, I actively use exploratory testing to uncover edge cases and hidden bugs early in the development cycle. While testing new features or enhancements, I explore the application beyond scripted test cases, interacting with the UI, testing boundary values, and trying unexpected inputs. I document all findings in detail, including bugs and test scenarios discovered during the session. This helps build a more comprehensive regression suite over time. I often pair exploratory testing with early automation and mock setups (like Postman mock servers) to enable Shift Left testing and ensure better test coverage even before backend services are fully integrated.
